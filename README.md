
This code uses OpenCV to track an object in a video stream and send the object's position to an Arduino. The Arduino then controls a servo motor to move the object in the desired direction.

Code

The code is written in Python and consists of two parts: the Python script and the Arduino sketch.

The Python script first imports the necessary libraries, including OpenCV, serial, and time. It then creates a Tracker object and initializes it with the first frame of the video stream.

The script then enters a loop where it reads the next frame from the video stream and updates the Tracker object. If the Tracker object successfully tracks the object, the script calculates the object's position and sends it to the Arduino.

The Arduino sketch first imports the necessary libraries, including Servo and Serial. It then defines a few variables, including the servo motor pins, the current position of the servo motors, and the state of the buttons.

The sketch then enters a loop where it reads the next character from the serial port. If the character is a 'r', the sketch moves the servo motor on pin 10 to the right. If the character is a 'l', the sketch moves the servo motor on pin 10 to the left. If the character is a 'u', the sketch moves the servo motor on pin 11 up. If the character is a 'd', the sketch moves the servo motor on pin 11 down.

Object Tracking with Arduino
This project uses OpenCV to track an object in a video stream and send the object's position to an Arduino. The Arduino then controls a servo motor to move the object in the desired direction.

Requirements
Python 3
OpenCV
Serial
Time
Arduino IDE
Instructions
Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries.
Open the object_tracking.py script in a text editor.
Change the video_file variable to the path of the video file you want to track.
Run the object_tracking.py script.
Open the object_tracking.ino sketch in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the sketch to the Arduino.
Move the object in the video stream.
The servo motor will move the object in the same direction.
